## Overview 

This is the model component of my team's NUVolunteers App.
Our application won first place in Northwestern's Institute of Electronic and Electrical Engineers competition 2025.

This repo hosts the models (content-based filtering and Langchain models) that deliver the recommendations to our application. It is currently hosted on Google Cloud Platform
